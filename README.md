# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

A simple yet interactive calculator written in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations and includes error handling and memory functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- Perform basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Memory feature: store and reuse the result of the last operation
- Continuous loop until user exits
- Graceful handling of:
  - Invalid numeric inputs
  - Division by zero
  - Non-positive number assertions

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter the **first number**
2. Choose an **operation**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` or `q` to quit
3. Enter the **second number**
4. The calculator:
   - Executes the operation
   - Displays the result
   - Saves the result in memory
5. On the next iteration, the user can type `'M'` instead of a number to use the stored memory result
   
## 🧠 Memory Feature

You can reuse the result from the previous calculation by entering `M` (case-insensitive) when asked for a number.

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x

You don't need any external libraries.
